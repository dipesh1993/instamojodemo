ðŸ“§ Subject: Request for Support Regarding Appraisal Process
Dear [Manager's Name],
I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to bring to your attention that I have completed two years with Firstferidian Pvt Ltd, and have been deployed at HDFC Bank for the past one year. Iâ€™m truly grateful for the learning and support I've received while working with your team.

However, as of now, I have not received any communication from my payroll company regarding the appraisal or performance review process, despite this being the usual time for such discussions. Since your feedback plays a significant role in the evaluation process, I kindly request if you could look into this or escalate it to the concerned team, if appropriate.

Iâ€™m eager to continue contributing to the team and grow professionally, and I would appreciate any support or guidance you can extend in helping move this process forward.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Warm regards,
Dipesh
